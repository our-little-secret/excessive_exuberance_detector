## Criteria for determining "overly positive" reviews
### Summary
Each review is scored using a modified sentiment analysis process using the
AIFF-165 word list to determine valence.

### How it is modified
Out of the box the sentiment analysis library used does not take into account
review length.

In an attempt to account for reviews of longer length typically
being rated higher I take the total valence score for each review and divide it
by the number of words in the review ending up with an average per word
positivity score.

The thinking being that a shorter message with a higher
average positivity score is more overly positive than a longer message with a
lower average.
